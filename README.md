# Project Title

## Overview

### Project summary

For my project I attempted to create a 4-player chess application, with
the goal of teaching myself React and TypeScript. By the time of my submission,
I was able to make the pieces able to be dragged and dropped between valid 
squares and also managed to implement most of the basic logic, such as capturing
and rules governing pieces. However, I still need to finish implementing
the remaining rules. I also wanted to create a server so that the game
could be played with friends, but didn't get around to it.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

A modern web browser such as Chrome or Firefox.

### Installation

Simply visit [CHESS ATTACK](https://chess-app-dannineccles.vercel.app/) and
start playing around with the web application.

### Deployment

1. Grab three friends and open [CHESS ATTACK](https://chess-app-dannineccles.vercel.app/).
2. Assign each friend a color and then take turns moving the chess pieces
until only one king remains.

Note that since the application is incomplete, only basic moves and captures
are currently possible.

### Acknowledgments

Much of my project was built off of modifications from the youtube video series
[Create a Chess Game with ReactJS](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBmRxydnERkysOgOS917Ojc_-uisgb8Aj).
Although I frequently looked through his videos when I got stuck to get an idea
for how to solve a problem, all coding was my own work and my project was
sufficiently different, being a 4-player game, that I ended up having to solve
problems he doesn't tackle.
